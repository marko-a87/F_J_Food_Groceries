Project Structure:

# Interface

    The visual part of the website which the customer can interact with

# Authentication

    Allows customer to login,register and use the website

# Business_Logic

    Allows cart functionality to take place, i.e add, remove and view

# Database

    Creates models and stores the customer information

Note:
  For the test cases  in Business_Logic I wrote the base functions for us to test our code. To run the test cases, all you need to do is to type in the terminal:
    python manage.py test Business_logic
  
  Make sure that when you're running the above command, that you are in the same directory of the manage.py file is in.
